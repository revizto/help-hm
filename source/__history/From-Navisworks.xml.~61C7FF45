    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">Navisworks is not designed for creating models, it combines various sources together and detects clashes. One of its sources is Revit. So, when you want to add a Navisworks source to your Revisto project, you should separately add the Revit part and exclude it from Navisworks exports (do not include geometry and sheets).</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">Note that when Navisworks and Revit sources are combined with the same Revisto model, the resulting view may appear to be corrupted due to coordinates mismatch. Before exporting Navisworks source data, make sure that it uses the same set and type of coordinates as the Revit file.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">Navisworks clashes are exported to Revisto as issues. Note that exporting separate clashes is not recommended. You have to make sure that clashes are conveniently and logically grouped within the source file.</text></para>
